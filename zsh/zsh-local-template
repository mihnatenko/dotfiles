# This is a custom zsh config file for local computer. Since it is loaded
# before oh-my-zsh, you can override it's properties, like theme, etc. Or you
# can include plugins that will be loaded. Like this:
# plugins += (golang)
#
# Or you can define custom commands that shouldn't be tracked in ~/.zshrc
